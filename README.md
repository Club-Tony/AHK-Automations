# Note: Not recommended for use if unfamiliar with functionality - Test and QC hotkey actions before using for any work tasks
### -----Additionally, due to lack of automatic coordinate scaling functionality based on window size/monitor size, the following requirements are necessary to ensure all scripts function properly-----
## Requirements:  
#### -3440 x 1440p (21:9 Aspect Ratio) Ultra-Wide monitor
#### -2 separate desktop instances for logistics software, one for Assign Recip, and one for Update
#### -Assign Recip should be hooked to left side of screen while active (WinKey+Left), and Update hooked to the right side (WinKey+Right)
#### -Firefox Browser (Must be used for online form helper hotkeys to function)
---
# Setup:
## Recommended: add shortcuts for the following files into Startup folder [Run Dialog (Win+R - Shell:Startup)], as they are meant to always be running and don't launch through Launcher Script: 
#### -Launcher Script (Keybinds)
#### -Alt+Q Map to Alt+F4
#### -Alt+R_Post_Parent_Normalize
#### -DSRF-to-UPS_WorldShip
#### -Intra_Buttons
#### -Intra_Focus_Fields
#### -Intra_Update_Tab_Shortcuts
#### -Intra_Window_Switch
#### -Resize_Intra_Search_Window
#### -Right Click
#### -ToolTips
#### -UPS_WorldShip_Shortcuts
#### -Yellow_Pouch
---
## Run 'Launcher Script (Keybinds)' to launch certain scripts with Hotkeys 
### Launcher Script hotkeys:
#### -Ctrl+Alt+T = ToolTips (Displays relevant Hotkey Menus depending on currently active window)
#### -Ctrl+Alt+L = Smartsheets
#### -Ctrl+Alt+I = SSJ-Intra 
#### -Ctrl+Alt+F = SSJ-Intra Searching
#### -Esc key = Exit launched scripts.
#### -Ctrl+Esc = Reloads all scripts (Useful for stopping automations mid way)
